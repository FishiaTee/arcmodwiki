## Archival Notice
This wiki is archived since July 25, 2025. No real work has been done since May 2024, and I myself do not play or interact with Arcaea and its surrounding communities actively anymore. I appreciate anyone who had helped writing this wiki in its early days, it was a fun experience learning how to reverse engineer native binaries.

This repository will stay archived going forward. I cannot guarantee that the methods described within it will work for newer versions of Arcaea, and if they don't then please research everything yourself. Any who wants to continue updating it are free to do so by forking it. All contents of the wiki are in public domain.

Below this notice is the original README, for archival purposes.

## Arcaea Modding Wiki

A work-in-progress centralized wiki for everything Arcaea modding related.

### Contributing
The entire wiki is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a fast static site generator, and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

You will need to have Python 3 installed.

Install all required dependencies by running the following command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements
```

After that, make any changes you want to make! All wiki pages are entirely made of Markdown, which is very beginner-friendly. When adding a new page, make sure to update `mkdocs.yml` too.

You can test your changes by running `mkdocs serve` on your computer which will host a local instance of the wiki directly on your computer. It will also auto refresh when changes are detected.

Once you have done what you need to, feel free to [send a Pull Request!](https://github.com/FishiaT/arcmodwiki/compare)
